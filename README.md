# WebTrafficMonitor

## Project Overview:

Web Traffic Monitor will track website traffic data, process it in real-time, and provide insights through a dashboard. The application will collect user activity data from various websites, process it using Kafka, store it in MySQL, and display relevant analytics on the frontend dashboard.

## Key Components:

<ol><li><strong>Data Collector:</strong> This component will simulate website traffic and generate user activity data, such as page views, clicks, and user interactions. It will send this data to Kafka for real-time processing.</li>

<li><strong>Kafka:</strong> Kafka will act as a message broker, receiving data from the Data Collector and forwarding it to various consumers. It ensures reliable, scalable, and distributed handling of incoming website traffic data.</li>

<li><strong>Data Processor:</strong> This component will consume data from Kafka, perform real-time processing (e.g., aggregating data, filtering, etc.), and store processed data into MySQL.</li>

<li><strong>MySQL:</strong> MySQL will serve as the database to store the processed website traffic data. It will be responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and querying.</li>

<li><strong>Frontend Dashboard:</strong> The frontend dashboard will provide visualizations and analytics based on the processed data. It will display metrics such as the number of visitors, popular pages, traffic patterns, and more.</li>

<li><strong>Kubernetes (Container Orchestration):</strong> We'll deploy the application components as containerized microservices using Kubernetes. Kubernetes will manage scaling, load balancing, and the overall health of the application.</li>
</ol>

## Architecture:

<ol>
<li>Data Flow:</li>

<ul><li>Website Traffic Data (Simulated) -> Data Collector -> Kafka -> Data Processor -> MySQL</li></ul>
<li>Deployment:</li>
<ul>
<li>Frontend Dashboard (React/Angular/Vue.js) -> Kubernetes Deployment</li>
<li>Data Processor (Spring Boot Application) -> Kubernetes Deployment</li>
<li>Kafka (Kubernetes StatefulSet)</li>
<li>MySQL (Kubernetes StatefulSet)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
